# views/

Views represent the Route of the app

## Alias

For this folder, we have an alias setup. So you can access this folder using

`import Home from '@views/Home';`

## Convention

Each view can have its own Routes.jsx file that represents internal Routes

Each view can have internal components in this case it will be stored inside `ViewName/` folder and the main component of the view will be named as `index.jsx`
