# services/

Here we keep our global services.

Service - something that provides some functionality or wraps external library with Facade, so we have control of the complexity and further changes 

## Alias

For this folder we have alias setup. So you can access this folder using. 

`import nameService from '@services/name.service';`

## Convention

You should name service file as `name.service.js`
