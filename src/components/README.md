# components/

Here we keep our global components.

## Alias

For this folder we have alias setup. So you can access this folder using. 

`import ComponentName from '@components/ComponentName';`

## How it works?

All components from this directory will be automatically exported from index.js file so you can access it as.

`import { ComponentName } from '@components';`
